- 👋 Hi, I’m @1OldSWguy
- 👀 I’m interested in enjoying retirement with a bit of good old software development thrown in.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to stay busy and avoid honey-doos by trying to keep up with the youngsters.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on open source SW development, hacOS for starters!
